# Fake-news-detector-using-LSTM-RNN
Developed a Deep learning model to identify when an article might be fake news by using LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) Recurrent Neural Network
# Dataset
Data set is given on kaggle website https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data
# Tasks
1. Preprocessed the text data by removing punctuation marks, stopwords and etc. with the help of nltk Framework
2. Performed one hot encoding including pad sequences
3. Applied word embedding on corpus file
5. Trained a single layer LSTM model with 100 neurons
4. Got an accuracy of 99% on training data and 90% on test data
